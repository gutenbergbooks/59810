<p class="tb">Shenandoah is one of seven National Parks east of the Mississippi
River. Set in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains of
Virginia, its most celebrated features are the succession of panoramas
from the crest of the ridge and the lush beauty of the
slopes. This is your park&mdash;we of the National Park Service
hope you will help protect and preserve it so that many future
generations may enjoy it. The superintendent and his staff are
here to help make your visit a happy one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION TO THE PARK</span></h2>
<p>Like a great, hazy shadow against the sky, the Blue Ridge
Mountains rise between the Piedmont and the Valley of Virginia.
The 105-mile Skyline Drive winds along the Blue Ridge
highland, crossing and recrossing the crest. It roughly bisects
Shenandoah National Park, which encompasses over 300 square
miles of scenic mountain country and claims 60 peaks that rise
3,000 to 4,000 feet. Seventy-five parking overlooks on the
drive give you panoramic views of the Piedmont to the east and
Shenandoah River Valley to the west. From Hogback Overlook,
on a clear day, you can count 11 bends in the river and
look down on fertile valleys where Indian villages once stood.</p>
<p>To know Shenandoah National Park, to discover its secrets,
you must take time to stop, look, and listen. For adventure,
you must explore. Leave your car at one of the overlooks or
visitor-use areas, and hike or ride horseback along the trail.
Between the drive and the park&rsquo;s boundaries are miles of ridges
and valleys, hills and hollows, laced with sparkling streams and
waterfalls. Trout lurk in shadowed pools, and wild gardens
of rock, vines, shrubs, and wildflowers nestle only a short walk
from the busy roadway.</p>
<p>At night, take time to look down on the twinkling lights of
Luray, in Shenandoah Valley, and to see the stars through air
so crystal-clear they seem almost within reach. On a rainy day,
watch the fog roll in like a tidal wave; on a sunny day, see the
cloud shadows sweep across hill and valley.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">FUN IN THE PARK</span></h2>
<h3><i>Dickey Ridge Visitor Center.</i></h3>
<p>This should be your starting
point, if you enter the park from the north, for it is just inside
mile 4.6 (see pp. <a href="#Page_10">10</a>-13 for mileposts). Wherever you enter,
be sure to stop here sometime before you leave the park.
Ranger-naturalists are on hand to orient you and help you get
all the information you need on hiking or camping, or whatever
you plan to do. A short sequence of color slides will give you
a general introduction to the park. The program describes
the variety of park attractions&mdash;trails, wildlife, wildflowers,
geology, and history.</p>
<h3><i>Visitor Activities Program.</i></h3>
<p>During the summer, ranger-naturalists
conduct a number of field trips daily to points of
interest and give nightly campfire programs at Skyland, Big
Meadows, or Lewis Mountain. The entire family can enjoy
these park-sponsored activities. In spring and autumn, park
naturalists present evening talks at concession lodges. For the
&ldquo;do-it-yourself&rdquo; visitor, self-guiding nature trails are open
throughout the year.</p>

<p>A complete schedule of these free interpretive activities is
found in the <i>Visitor Activities Program</i>, available at all park
and concession installations in Shenandoah National Park, or
by writing to the Park Superintendent, Luray, Va.</p>
<h3><i>Hiking.</i></h3>
<p>The park is a hiker&rsquo;s paradise, with over 200 miles
of foot trails, including a 94-mile link of the famous Appalachian
Trail, which extends more than 2,000 miles from Maine
to Georgia. The park maintains a series of open shelters along
the trails, conveniently spaced a day&rsquo;s hike apart. Each hiker
should bring his own bedroll for use on one of the six spring-covered
bunks furnished in most of the shelters. These bunks
are occupied on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<p>Detailed hikers&rsquo; guides and maps of the trail system can be
ordered by mail. (See <a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a>, <span class="smaller">PREPARING FOR YOUR VISIT</span>.)</p>
<h3><i>Horseback riding.</i></h3>
<p>There are about 25 miles of scenic horse
trails in the park. Horses (and ponies for children) can be
rented at hourly rates at Skyland and Big Meadows.</p>
<h3><i>Photography.</i></h3>
<p>A filter is advisable when you are taking
panoramic views, for haze is often present without your even
noticing it. You will get better definition and more interesting
shadows if you take your pictures in the morning or late afternoon,
rather than in the flat light of midday.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>With a long exposure you can get most dramatic photographs
at sunset when the trees and rocks stand out against the western
sky in silhouette. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to go out and shoot black-and-white
film in the fog or during a storm; cloud effects often
are more striking than ever. If you want good pictures of wildlife,
a telephoto lens will help.</p>
<h3><i>Fishing.</i></h3>
<p>The fun of fishing awaits the eager angler along
the park streams. There, to try your skill, are native brook
trout. At the park entrance stations you can get rules and regulations
governing angling and also directions to fishing waters.
You will need a Virginia fishing license. A 3-day limit, nonresident
trout fishing license is available at all concession units
in the park for $3.</p>
<h3><i>Picnicking.</i></h3>
<p>Campers and picnickers come from all over to
take advantage of Shenandoah&rsquo;s superb facilities for 9 months
of the year. Fireplaces make it easy to prepare steaks or fish
or even pancakes. Your frying pan rests on a grill as steady
as your own stove. Choose one of the picnic areas along the
drive for your evening meal, and then walk out and watch the
sunset. (Picnic grounds are noted on the map, pp. <a href="#Page_10">10</a>-13.)</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">AT HOME IN THE PARK</span></h2>
<h3><i>Where To Stay.</i></h3>
<p>All of the lodging and restaurant facilities,
the gift shops, and service stations in Shenandoah National
Park are operated by the Virginia Sky-Line Co., Inc. While
types of accommodations in the park are limited, there is a wide
choice of cabins, tourist homes, motels, and hotels in nearby
communities, which are available the year round.</p>
<p>Hotel-type accommodations may be obtained in the park at
Big Meadows. Cabins, with rooms and private connecting
baths, may be rented at Skyland, Big Meadows, and Lewis
Mountain. These accommodations are closed during winter.
There are no cabins equipped for housekeeping.</p>
<p>As rates are subject to change from season to season, no prices
for facilities are given in this booklet. Reservations and rates
may be secured from the Virginia Sky-Line Co., Inc., Luray, Va.
Whenever possible, lodging reservations should be made in
advance, particularly from early July through October. You
are urged to plan your trip to the park during the middle of the
week to avoid congested periods over weekends.</p>
<h3><i>Camping.</i></h3>
<p>Campers and picnickers should bring camp stoves
or fuel for fireplaces since wood is not always available. Food
supplies, ice, charcoal burners, and fuel may be obtained at
Big Meadows Wayside. Electricity is not available. Use of
campgrounds is free but is limited to 14 days in any one year.
Reservations for campsites cannot be made; the policy is
first come, first served.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h3><i>Shelters.</i></h3>
<p>There are 20 open shelters, each sleeping 6 persons
(see map, pp. <a href="#Page_10">10</a>-13); they cannot be reserved, and hikers
must bring their own bedding. However, locked, equipped
cabins are available by reservation from the Potomac Appalachian
Trail Club, 1916 Sunderland Place NW., Washington 6,
D. C. A small nightly charge is made for the locked cabins.</p>
<h3><i>Restaurants</i></h3>
<p>are operated by the Virginia Sky-Line Company
at Panorama, Skyland, Big Meadows, and Big Meadows Wayside,
Lewis Mountain, and Swift Run Gap. Light lunches are
available at Elkwallow; groceries, at Big Meadows Wayside.</p>
<h3><i>Mail</i></h3>
<p>is delivered daily to the lodges; campers should direct
their mail to be sent in care of General Delivery, Luray, Va.</p>
<h3><i>Long-distance telephone service</i></h3>
<p>is available 24 hours a day
at the developed areas.</p>

<p>Skyland, at 3,680 feet elevation, is the highest point on Skyline
Drive. Here in the largest of the park&rsquo;s developed areas
are accommodations for 350 persons. The lodge is the center
of the community, with groups of multiple-unit cottages scattered
within walking distance along the ridge and under the
trees. Besides dining room, coffeeshop, and gift shop, there
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
are lounges for use on chilly nights and a terrace for lazy
sunning.</p>
<p>Skyland is the starting point for many of the guided walks
and horseback trips; stables are just downhill from the lodge.
The campfire circle is the scene of naturalist talks on fine evenings;
in rainy weather you will find them in the recreation
hall, &ldquo;under the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t leave this area until you hike the 1&frac12;-mile round trip
to Stony Man Mountain. You saw the rock profile in view
for many miles if you approached Skyland from the north.
From this cliff of weathered, greenstone rock, the view is sheerly
downward to the valley, and sweepingly across to the Massanutten
Mountain, a hazy blue in the distance. The half-day
hikes to Whiteoak Canyon, and to the summit of Marys Rock
(trail starts at Panorama), as well as shorter walks to Millers
Head, Little Stony Man Cliffs, and Hawksbill Mountain, are
most easily reached from Skyland.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">BIG MEADOWS</span></h2>
<p>Second largest of the developed areas, Big Meadows has a
hospitable lodge with spacious veranda, surrounded by individual
cottages. These, together with a few lodge rooms,
accommodate 250 persons. Tent, trailer, and picnic grounds
are a part of the development. The lodge dining room is open
to all visitors. At Big Meadow Wayside, you will find a
coffeeshop, small grocery store, gift shop, and service station.
Horseback trips from Big Meadows begin near the ranger
station.</p>
<p>The great charm of Big Meadows lies in its open fields, in
contrast to the forests on every hand. The fragrant meadows
once were heavily grazed, keeping down the trees that only
now, after 30 years, are starting to come back.</p>
<p>Of considerable interest is a swamp in one part of the fields,
destination of the self-guiding trail fittingly called the Swamp
Trail. Usually the pathway is quite dry, but in the damp
areas nearby is an unusual variety of vegetation&mdash;gray birch,
cardinal flower, and American burnet, all rare in the park.
Remnants of the ghost forest of gaunt chestnut trees still stand.
From the edge of the meadows there are fine views of the
valley. An equally relaxing walk of another kind&mdash;along a
forest trail&mdash;is to Dark Hollow Falls, a round trip of 3&frac12; miles
from the lodge.</p>
<p>Campfire talks are held in the amphitheater several times a
week in summer, and in the lodge in spring and autumn.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">LEWIS MOUNTAIN</span></h2>
<p>At mile 57.6, Lewis Mountain is the southernmost and the
smallest accommodations area in the park&mdash;room for only 24
people. But besides the cabins, there is a coffeeshop and
camp and picnic grounds. Park naturalists present campfire
programs during the summer.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The mountains of the Blue Ridge are rounded by ages of erosion.</i></p>
</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">GEOLOGY</span></h2>
<p>Geologists tell us how the rounded, forest-covered mountains
of the Blue Ridge record more than a billion years of the
earth&rsquo;s history. The two types of granitic basement rocks are
the oldest. These rocks were formed many thousands of feet
beneath the surface of the earth, as large masses of magma
(molten rock) cooled and crystallized very slowly. One type
of granitic rock (hypersthene granodiorite) is exposed at Marys
Rock Tunnel, and along the crest and on the western flank of
the Blue Ridge. The other type is a much coarser grained
granite. It is named Old Rag granite for exposures found on
that mountain and in the area east of the crest of the Blue Ridge.
Both of these granitic rocks were changed by heat and pressure
(metamorphism), which accounts for their layered or laminated
(gneissic) textures at many locations.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of years ago, long before the present
landscape was formed, erosion carved an ancestral terrain of
mountains, hills, and canyons into the ancient granitic rock.
There were no trees, wildflowers, or animals to relieve the
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
barrenness of the wind- and rain-swept landscape. A half-billion
years ago, only a few primitive plants (algae) may have
spotted the jagged granite hills.</p>
<p>Then, from a series of long cracks or fissures in the earth,
layer after layer of lava poured out until most of the granitic
hills were submerged in a vast, level plain of lava. These basaltic
outpourings formed the principal rocks of the Catoctin
formation. Long after the lavas had hardened, they were
radically altered by intense metamorphism into completely new
groups of minerals, which give the rock its present characteristic
green color, and its name&mdash;greenstone. This extremely
durable greenstone schist caps many of the highest peaks in
Shenandoah.</p>
<p>The lava plateau sank slowly beneath advancing Paleozoic
seas. Some 30,000 feet of sea-floor sediments were deposited
in a vast trough, or geosyncline. Only the very lowest or oldest
rocks from this age are now found in the north and south districts
of the park. They belong to the Chilhowee series, but
throughout the central district even these have been stripped
by erosion from the crest of the Blue Ridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Near the end of the Paleozoic era (some 180 million years
ago), the sediments of the Appalachian geosyncline were subjected
to intense compression by tremendous unknown forces
acting from the southeast. These intense pressures slowly
wrinkled, folded, shoved, and fractured the ancient granites,
lavas, and sea-floor sediments into a great original Appalachian
mountain system, which stood several times higher than
the present mountains. Most of the younger rocks were
shoved into parallel mountain ridges to the west of the Blue
Ridge and now form the Allegheny Mountains. Continuous
erosion has stripped thousands of feet of material from the
former alplike mountains. Vast quantities of this material
have been transported to the sea. Some of it was deposited
in local basins to the east during the Triassic period. The
Triassic redbeds are now being uncovered by erosion along
Lee Highway (U.S. 211) and in the road cuts west of Bull
Run or Manassas Battlefield. Even today the geologic forces
continue, almost unnoticed, to change and shape the land.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">PLANTS</span></h2>
<p>Ninety-five percent of the Blue Ridge is wooded, and much
of this forest is made up of scarlet, red, and chestnut oaks. On
the ridges and dry slopes there may also be hickory, black locust,
black birch, and scattered maple, black gum, ash, and pine.
In moister coves there is a greater variety of species including
white oak, maple, birch, yellow-poplar, sycamore, and basswood.
In cooler coves and on north slopes, hemlocks are
dominant. At higher elevations, red spruce and balsam fir
stand as relics of the northern forest type that covered the Blue
Ridge during the more arctic conditions of the Pleistocene Age.</p>
<p>The limberlost at the head of Whiteoak Canyon contains
hemlocks that are over 400 years old and 3 feet in diameter.
The dead trunks of some giant American chestnuts are still
standing, but these trees are no longer a part of the Blue Ridge
forest&mdash;they were killed out by the chestnut blight. The forests
of 300 years ago were cut for wood products and to clear
land, and their regrowth was prevented by fire and grazing.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s forest contains mostly small trees. The older oaks
along the exposed ridge lines have been twisted and broken by
ice and wind. In many places open fields are becoming overgrown
with scrub pine, black locust, sassafras, and other early
invaders. These lead the way for the return of the climax oak
forest that will again someday clothe the mountains.</p>
<p>The changing seasons make the variety of Shenandoah&rsquo;s
woody plants conspicuous. The flowers of redbud, dogwood,
wild cherry, black locust, azalea, and mountain laurel make
spring a veritable fairyland. The autumn color parade begins
with black gum and red maple, varied and added to by hickories,
dogwood, ash, and sassafras, until the climax of oaks makes
the slopes blaze with red and orange, then subside to russet and
brown. The gray of winter branches is relieved only by the
dark green of pine, spruce, fir, and hemlock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>From March to November, you will find flowers blooming
in the Blue Ridge. So many kinds: 80 different flowering
plants can be identified in a day&rsquo;s walk.</p>
<p>In the spring, hepatica and masses of violets, bluets, and
marsh marigolds brave the uncertain weather of March and
April, followed by the bloodroot, trillium, and jack-in-the-pulpit.
Summer brings great clumps of goldenrod and Queen
Anne&rsquo;s lace, asters, daisies, and black-eyed-susans along the
roadside. In the fields look for columbine, the showy turks-cap
lily, and the purple thistle.</p>
<p>Autumn&rsquo;s brilliant leaves compete with the flower displays,
but many varieties hold their own&mdash;goldenrod, asters, chicory,
yarrow, fireweed, and ironweed. To all these are added the
bright fruits of the dogwood, white baneberry, sumac, and
mountain ash. It is no wonder that October draws more visitors
to the park than any other month except July.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">WILDLIFE</span></h2>
<h3><i>Birds.</i></h3>
<p>This park is an exciting place for birdwatchers who
could, if they had time and patience, spot more than 100 different
species at the height of the spring migration (April and
May). Other migrants bring the year&rsquo;s total to 200.</p>
<p>You will notice first of all the soaring birds&mdash;buzzards, vultures,
and ravens&mdash;because they are constantly &ldquo;floating&rdquo; over
mountaintops and valleys. Take a few minutes to watch the
raven do his stunts. He&rsquo;s the acrobat of the park&rsquo;s bird population.
Like a highly maneuverable aircraft, he dives and stalls,
somersaults and soars for hours on end, apparently with no aim
but to have a good time.</p>
<p>On the roadside, watch for the indigo bunting and junco, the
ruffed grouse, and, in the southern part of the park, the wild
turkey. Along the trail you will hear the towhee call his
name; the hammering of the woodpecker; the call of the whip-poor-will
and the mourning dove; the screech of the jay.</p>
<p>The woods are filled with songbirds; if you listen closely,
you may hear oven-birds, red-eyed vireoes, nuthatches, chickadees,
catbirds, wrens, brown-thrashers, and black-throated blue
warblers.</p>
<p>Bring your bird guide along. You will find your hikes and
walks greatly enriched by being able to identify the birds you
see and hear, and you may introduce the whole family to a new
interest that will reward you wherever you travel.</p>
<h3><i>Mammals.</i></h3>
<p>Because the Blue Ridge was dominated by man
for over 200 years, wild animals both large and small became
scarce. Now, under park protection, deer and bears, bobcats
and foxes are increasing in number. Of these, most likely you
will see the white-tailed deer in the early morning or evening
in open meadows. Watch for them at Skyland, near the
Whiteoak parking area, at Big Meadows, and at the edge of
the forests, particularly in the northern part of the park.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The woodchuck feeds all day long on the shoulders of the
drive, but because he is the same color as the rocks, you may
miss him. The friendly, noisy chipmunk you will find in camp
and picnic grounds. Gray squirrels are numerous in the woods
and cottontails in meadows and clearings. Flying squirrels
are active only at night.</p>
<p>Also, after dark be on the lookout for the pert, masked face
of the raccoon. He, as well as the familiar black-and-white
coat of the skunk, may turn up in the glare of your headlights.</p>
<h3><i>Fishes.</i></h3>
<p>An interesting assortment of native fishes lives in
quiet pools and turbulent riffles of park streams. In cooler
headwaters, brook trout find a favourite home. Suckers, shiners,
dace, bass, and sunfish join the trout in warmer waters farther
downstream. More than 20 kinds of fishes inhabit the park
waters. The American eel makes its long migration from the
Shenandoah streams to the Atlantic Ocean to spawn and then
return upstream.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">THE SEASONS</span></h2>
<p>Shenandoah National Park is open the year round. However,
you may occasionally find Skyline Drive closed for short
periods because of ice, snow, or heavy fog. Big Meadows
Campground is open the year around, and lodge and cottage
accommodations are available from April through October;
exact dates depend on the weather. Entrance fees are
suspended during the winter.</p>
<h3><i>Spring.</i></h3>
<p>When the buds turn red on the maple trees, you
know that spring is on the way to the Blue Ridge. Soon, the
pale-green veil of new leaves begins to creep slowly&mdash;about a
hundred feet a day&mdash;up the slopes from the valley floor until
the mountainsides are painted with the color of spring. In
the woods, the violets and marsh marigolds are blooming together
in clumps beside the springs, and tiny blossoms appear
everywhere in sunny patches on the forest floor. The air is
crisp and fresh. Except for a few mild days, it is cold in the
park until June. Along the drive, the dogwood and redbud
bloom early, followed by azalea and black locust, and in early
June by the delicate pink and white of laurel.</p>
<h3><i>Summer.</i></h3>
<p>These are the hazy, lazy days that often bring
afternoon thunderstorms and spectacular waves of fog that
sweep across the mountaintops and hide the valleys. Temperatures
are a comfortable 15&deg; lower than those in the valley&mdash;mid-80&rsquo;s
in the daytime, mid-40&rsquo;s at night. At midday, the air
is heavy with the damp, earthy smell of the woods, and the
sweet scent of wildflowers in the fields. It is a good time of
year to go for a leisurely walk in the woods, where shade is
everywhere, or to pluck blackberries and blueberries in the Big
Meadows. And if a shower catches up with you, you&rsquo;ll be dry
again before you get back. We suggest that you take a short
walk out to Stony Man or Crescent Rock and gaze at the incredible
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
patchwork of farm and field in the valley below. Field
glasses will add to your enjoyment of this view.</p>
<h3><i>Autumn.</i></h3>
<p>This time of year brings the &ldquo;down-flowing&rdquo; of
autumn color from mountaintops to the coves and hollows. By
mid-September the foliage has begun to change, starting with
the Virginia creeper. Exquisite patches of color&mdash;the blood-red
of the gum, the red and yellow of the maple&mdash;appear in
large areas of green, and soon whole mountainsides have
&ldquo;caught fire.&rdquo; There is a series of &ldquo;color-peaks&rdquo; as varied as
the different latitudes and altitudes within the park, but the
most lavish displays usually occur between October 10 and 20.
This is hiking weather, and campfire-picnic weather.</p>
<h3><i>Winter.</i></h3>
<p>Do not discount the beauty of the Blue Ridge in
winter when the trees shed their leaves and open up new vistas.
Now, you can see long distances in every direction. The cold
crisp days are brilliant, and the evergreens stand out like bright-green
exclamations against the snowy white of the hillsides.
After a storm, with the roads freshly cleared, you can come up
and inspect Stony Man, who will be wearing a frosty beard.
Gleaming icicles cascade over a cliff like a frozen Niagara. On
crisp winter mornings observe the ghostly fog &ldquo;fingers&rdquo; that
protrude from branches like ruffled white plumes.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">HUMAN HISTORY</span></h2>
<p>There is no record&mdash;except for isolated artifacts&mdash;of Indian
inhabitants in Shenandoah National Park. The Shawnee and
the Moneton, Saponi, and Manahoac were reported in the valleys
during the 17th century, but they wandered into the mountains
only occasionally to hunt.</p>
<p>It is not surprising, then, that John Lederer found only deer,
bears, and wolves when he arrived in the present area of Big
Meadows with his Indian guides. Virginia&rsquo;s Governor, Sir
William Berkeley, had sent him, in 1669, to explore the unknown
mountains. Lederer is the first known white man to
venture into the uncharted Blue Ridge.</p>
<p>In 1716, Gov. Alexander Spotswood, also seeking westward
expansion for Virginia, led 50 men on horseback through Swift
Run Gap and down the western slope to see the Shenandoah
Valley, where they camped by the river they called &ldquo;Euphrates.&rdquo;
After their return home Spotswood proclaimed them &ldquo;Knights
of the Golden Horseshoe,&rdquo; and presented each a tiny gold
horseshoe.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, English, German, and Scotch-Irish pioneers
began to settle in the valleys. They gradually moved up
into the coves and hollows of the Blue Ridge. By 1760, roads
were being built, and grist mills, sawmills, cider presses, and
tanneries were common sights. The first toll turnpike, in 1785,
crossed the mountains at Thornton Gap (Panorama). It was
named for Francis Thornton, who settled there in 1733. Other
important roads crossed at Swift Run and Browns Gap, in the
southern section of the park.</p>
<p>In the early years, the settlers of the Blue Ridge coves and
hollows wrested a comfortable living from their farms and
domestic industries. They sold lumber products and tanbark
to the lowland settlers for cash and thus could buy things they
could not produce.</p>
<p>For some 20 years before the Civil War, there was iron and
copper mining in the Blue Ridge. The mountain people were
not much affected by this short-lived industry and by the time
the war came, the ores had been worked out. You can see
remnants of the old copper mines on the Stony Man Nature
Trail.</p>
<p>During the Civil War, both the Piedmont and the Shenandoah
Valley became battlegrounds; Browns Gap was used by
Jackson as an important thoroughfare in the Campaign of 1862,
and Signal Knob became a major communications point. You
can see Signal Knob from the Shenandoah Valley Overlook.</p>
<p>When the railroad came to the Shenandoah Valley, heavy
machinery and larger, more efficient industry came with it.
Many mills and tanyards that served small communities through
the skill and energy of one man or family became quiet, then
decayed into the landscape. Demand for the mountaineers&rsquo;
crafts decreased. They had little cash income left except from
moonshining and chestnuts. By 1915, the fungus chestnut
blight had destroyed most of the chestnut trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Isolated from the rapidly changing lowlands, and with their
forest and soil resources depleted, the mountain people were
reduced to subsistence farming.</p>
<p>As the years passed, the population of the mountains east of
the Shenandoah dwindled. However, there were still over 2,000
people living on the lands which were acquired by the State of
Virginia for Shenandoah National Park. Before the land was
deeded to the Federal Government, these people, more than 400
families, moved to new homes. The self-sufficient families
moved without assistance. The very old and the disabled were
helped by the State Welfare Department. About 300 families
were moved into homesteads by the U. S. Resettlement Administration.
Here each family had the use of a house and small
farm with the privilege of long-term purchase.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">A PARK EMERGES</span></h2>
<p>The first official act in forming the park was the appointment
of the Southern Appalachian National Park Committee. The
Secretary of the Interior appointed the committee to survey the
Blue Ridge and other eastern regions as sites for future National
Parks. After hearing the report, local groups were
formed to promote the project.</p>
<p>The Shenandoah National Park Association, formed in 1925,
became an instrument of this movement. In 9 months its members
raised $1,249,000. Twenty-four thousand Virginians
pledged this amount to buy up the necessary property at $6
an acre. The Virginia Assembly voted an additional million
dollars to help buy up the 3,870 private tracts, and in 1926
Congress formally authorized establishment of the park.</p>
<p>Eight years went by before the land was totally acquired.
In the interim the Skyline Drive, which early had been visualized
as one of the major attractions of the park, was begun in
1931. In 1934 the first section was opened to the public.</p>
<p>At Big Meadows, on July 3, 1936, Shenandoah National
Park was dedicated &ldquo;to present and succeeding generations of
Americans for the recreation and the re-creation&rdquo; they were
to find there.</p>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">PRESERVING THE PARK</span></h2>
<p>You may wonder why dead trees and fallen logs are not
removed, why streams are not dammed for swimming, and why
certain plants and animals are not brought into the park and
others removed.</p>
<p>The answer is in the fundamental policy of the National
Park Service to maintain the National Parks in their natural
state. The landscape scars&mdash;remnants of roads and fences,
and grazed-over land&mdash;will disappear in time. The forests
will come back to cover the farmlands, and in its own way the
wildlife will balance and adjust to this forest ecology. These
are the things you see taking place in your National Parks all
over the country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>And so we ask you not to disturb the flowers or trees in any
way, and not to collect rock specimens. You can help to protect
the wildlife by driving carefully. Hunting is prohibited
anywhere in the park.</p>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">PREPARING FOR YOUR VISIT</span></h2>
<h3><i>Books and Maps.</i></h3>
<p>Knowing something about the park before
your visit will help you enjoy it more. You can order
books and maps from the Shenandoah Natural History Association
(a nonprofit organization), c/o Shenandoah National
Park, Luray, Va., or buy them at the visitor center or at park
headquarters. The association will send you a list of titles
and prices. The following publications are representative.</p>
<p>The book, <i>Skyland, Heart of Shenandoah National Park</i>,
based on the autobiography of George Freeman Pollock, contains
early photographs. <i>The Mammals of Shenandoah National
Park</i> describes the wildlife in the park with stories and
photographs. The illustrated book, <i>101 Wildflowers of
Shenandoah National Park</i>, is an excellent flower guide.
Topographic trail maps of north, central, and south sections
of the park and a booklet describe <i>20 Circuit Hikes</i>.</p>
<p>Describing not only Shenandoah, but all of our parks, is
Freeman Tilden&rsquo;s <i>The National Parks</i>.</p>
<h3><i>What To Bring.</i></h3>
<p>Summer sportswear for daytime; sweaters
and topcoats for evening (tuck in a raincoat, too). Bring
sturdy shoes for walking; non-skid soles are good for rocks and
slippery trails. Binoculars, or field glasses, will double your
appreciation of the park, especially of its birds and animals.
Do not forget your camera; film is available at the lodges.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">HOW TO REACH THE PARK</span></h2>
<p>There are four main entrances to the park along the Skyline
Drive. These are:</p>
<p><i>North Entrance</i> (Front Royal, Va.): From U.S. 340 and
Va. 55 and 522.</p>
<p><i>Thornton Gap</i> (Mile 31.6): From U.S. 211.</p>
<p><i>Swift Run Gap</i> (Mile 65.7): From U.S. 33.</p>
<p><i>South Entrance</i> (Rockfish Gap): From U.S. 250, and from
the Blue Ridge Parkway.</p>
<p>The Blue Ridge Parkway, when completed, will link Shenandoah
National Park with Great Smoky Mountains National
Park, a distance of 469 miles. A unit of the National Park
System, the parkway is more than two-thirds complete. Short
detours are well marked. Information on road conditions can
be obtained at the entrance stations.</p>
<h3><i>Bus service</i></h3>
<p>is available at nearby towns all year. Virginia
Trailways, Charlottesville, Va., operates tours to and through
the park from late May through October. Call Trailways
terminals for reservations and information.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">PARK REGULATIONS</span></h2>
<h3><i>Traffic.</i></h3>
<p>The speed limit is 35 miles per hour. Park
rangers, in charge of traffic control, investigate all accidents.
When necessary they gather material for preparation
of court cases to be heard before a park commissioner.</p>
<p>Signal when crossing the road to overlooks. Drive slowly
on curves and in rainy weather when roads are slippery. In
fog, observe &ldquo;Travel Not Advised&rdquo; warnings; they are posted
for your safety. If you must proceed, use your driving lights.</p>
<p>The solid centerline in the road is for your safety. Keep
to the right. Pass only when your sight distance permits.</p>
<h3><i>Fires.</i></h3>
<p>Build fires only in fireplaces at picnic areas and campgrounds.
Be sure your campfire is out! Be careful with
cigarettes; do not throw them from your automobile or along
the trail. Remember, fire is the forest&rsquo;s greatest enemy.</p>
<h3><i>Pets.</i></h3>
<p>Dogs and cats must be on a leash at all times, or
otherwise confined.</p>
<h3><i>Litter.</i></h3>
<p>You will find trash receptacles in all parking and
picnic areas. Deposit your refuse there&mdash;do not throw it along
the road like a litterbug!</p>
<h3><i>Camping</i></h3>
<p>is limited to 14 days in any one year. Campsites
cannot be reserved; when they are filled, rangers will direct you
to temporary campgrounds.</p>
<h3><i>Fishing.</i></h3>
<p>A Virginia license is required. Trout fishing
only permitted. A 3-day-$3 nonresident trout fishing license
is available at all concession units in the park. Obtain a complete
set of fishing regulations from a park ranger at the entrance
station as you come into the park, or write to the
superintendent for a set.</p>
<h3><i>Firearms.</i></h3>
<p>Assembled firearms and similar devices, including
air pistols and rifles, bows and arrows, and slingshots, are prohibited.
Shenandoah National Park is a sanctuary for all wildlife,
and the hunting, killing, wounding, frightening, or
capturing of any wildlife is prohibited.</p>
<div class="box">
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">VISITOR-USE FEES</span></h2>
<p>Vehicle permit fees are collected at entrance stations.
If you arrive when an entrance station is unattended, you
must obtain a permit before leaving the park. Fees are
not listed herein because they are subject to change, but
the information may be obtained by writing to the superintendent.</p>
<p>Fee revenues are deposited in the U.S. Treasury; they
offset, in part, the cost of operating and maintaining the
National Parks.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">ADMINISTRATION</span></h2>
<p>Shenandoah National Park is administered by the National
Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior.</p>
<p>The National Park System, of which this park is a unit, is
dedicated to conserving the scenic, scientific, and historic heritage
of the United States for the benefit and enjoyment of its
people.</p>
<p>Development of this park is part of MISSION 66, a 10-year
conservation program to unfold the full potential of the National
Park System for the use and enjoyment of both present
and future generations.</p>
<p>The administrative offices of Shenandoah National Park are
located 4 miles west of Thornton Gap and 4 miles east of Luray,
Va., on Lee Highway (U.S. 211). If you have questions or
comments about the park, send them to the Superintendent,
Shenandoah National Park, Luray, Va.</p>
<p><i>Park Rangers</i> are the protective force of the park, and are
assigned to enforce park regulations, and to help and advise
you during your stay. Consult them if you are in any difficulty,
or need information. Ranger stations are indicated on the map
on pages <a href="#Page_10">10</a>-13.</p>
<p><i>Park Naturalists</i> are here to help you understand and enjoy
the park&rsquo;s features. You will meet the naturalists at the visitor
center, at evening campfire talks, and on conducted walks.
They welcome your questions and comments.</p>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">AMERICA&rsquo;S NATURAL RESOURCES</span></h2>
<p>Created in 1849, the Department of the Interior&mdash;America&rsquo;s
Department of Natural Resources&mdash;is concerned with the management,
conservation, and development of the Nation&rsquo;s water,
wildlife, mineral, forest, and park and recreational resources.
It also has major responsibilities for Indian and territorial
affairs.</p>
<p>As the Nation&rsquo;s principal conservation agency, the Department

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
